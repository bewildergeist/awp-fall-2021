This React app is meant to be used with the _auth_api_ from the previous lesson.

If you `npm start` the API from within `lesson11/auth_api` it will start up on http://localhost:8080 and if you `npm start` the React app from the directory that this README file is in, it will start up on http://localhost:3000 and connect to the running API.
